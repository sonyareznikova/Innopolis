# Konstantin Sozykin, BS3-5
Hello dear old fried. How are you? And how about our common friends? Sorry for waiting, but I've been incredibly busy. 

Final exams are comming. I do by best to preapare for this.  

You know, I am feeling exhausted at this december days. I really want to go home and do nothing. I am kidding. It's joke :).

For this winter holydays I have a lot of plans. Firstly it is MOOC courses from Internet. Yes, I tired from lectures, but not from learning.

Secondly, it is computer games. From summer to autumn a lot of titles was published. I didn't have chance to play them. My favorite in this season it's Fallout 4. I think, You finished it in first day.

Thridly, it is cinema. I am really miss for days, When we was in cinema in every week. It was very nice. I think we can fix that at this winter weekends. It's sad that it will be very short holydays. 

Best regards, Konstantin S. you
