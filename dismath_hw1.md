#Integers. Prove or disprove:  

	1)  If a*b = a: prove that b = 1.
		Lets mul on (1/a) and on 1 -> a * (1/a) * b * 1 = a * (1/a) * 1 -> b = 1
	2)  The difference of any two odd integers is even. 
	    Every odd can be represented as 2k + 1, then (2k1 + 1) - (2k2 + 1) =  2(k1 + k2) = 2*m
	
#Prime numbers 

	1)  Is n^k – 1 prime for any integers n and k? Answer is No
	
	2)  Is expression n^2 – n + 41 a prime number? 
	    Answer is No. For contr-example if n = 41, then n^2 – n + 41 = 41*41-41+41 =  1681
 	
#Divisibility 

	1)  Prove that sum of 2n + 1 consecutive numbers is divisible by 2n + 1
		s = a+1+a+2+a+3...a+2*n + 1
		
		k = 2*n + 1
		
		a+1+a+2+a+...a+k = ak + k(k+1)/2 = (2ak + k(k+1))/2 = k(2*a+k+1)/2
		
		Now it is easy to see, that s divisible by k = 2n+1
		
	2)  Find quotient and divisor of: 
		a.   n^3 + 2n – 1 divided by n: n^3 + 2n - 1 = n*(n^2 + 2) - 1
		
		b.   12n^5+10n^4+2 divided by 2n + 1 :12n^5+10n^4+2 = (2n + 1) * (6n^4 + 2n^3 - n + 0.5n - 0.25) + 2.25

#Rational numbers and Real numbers
	
	1) Write each rational number as a ratio of two integers: 
		a.  0.462716271…
		    Lets writhe the eqation:
		    0.4 + x = 0.46271, where x is
		    
		b.  12.1121121… 
		
	2) Prove or disprove :  
		a.  If r is any rational number, then 3r2 − 2r + 4 is rational.  
		b.  Product and sum of two rational numbers is rational.
