I want to add some notes before preset to you my way to writing papers.

Fist I think about beginning and ending of paper. In my option it's most important and hardest parts of writing.
If it it's done I think about middle part of paper. It is not a continues process. I mean than that fist part of paper can be started at one day, and finished in other.  
It is hard to me concentrate on one part during long time. 
So  finally, my writing process include following steps:
- [X] Think about paper template. (Beginning, Ending and Middle parts)
- [X] Split it to paragraph in my mind
- [X] Turn on online music player with hardcore punk and metal songs.
- [X] Make sure than automatic spell checker at my favorite text editor is working (Russian and English)
- [X] Start to Work on paper during approximately 30 minutes.
- [X] Switch to other activity like coding or reading with parallel thinking about paper.
- [X] Return to work on a paper
- [X] Repeat Switching until work will be done
- [X] Give paper to some one with good grammar skills
