I want to add some notes before preseting my way of writing papers to you.

First, I think about the beginning and the ending of a paper. In my option it's the most important and hardest part of writing. When it's done I think about the middle part of a paper. It is not a continuous process. I mean that the first part of a paper can be started at one day, and finished at the other. It is hard for me to concentrate on one part during a long time.

Actually, before this task I didn't think about my writing process. Sometimes it looks for me like chaotic process. But after some reflections in my mind I found some patterns of my writing process.


So finally, my writing process includes following steps:

 - [X] Think about paper template. (Beginning, Ending and Middle parts)
 - [X] Split it into paragraphs in my mind
 - [X] Turn on online music player with hardcore punk and metal songs.
 - [X] Make sure that automatic spell checker at my favorite text editor is working (Russian and English)
 - [X] Add the file with the paper to my cloud or version control system.
 - [X] Start working on paper during approximately 30 minutes.
 - [X] Switch to other activity like coding or reading or drinking coffe with parallel thinking about paper.
 - [X] Return to work on a paper
 - [X] Repeat switching until work will be done
 - [X] Give paper to someone with good grammar skills
 - [X] Fix issues after someone has checked my work.

Maybe it is not common for people, but anyway, the last part of this list is so stressfully for me. Speaking about this task, I did it according to the presented scheme.
