And at the last computer vision is

Why I like this fields? Because it has  range of applications in different areas : from financial markets to brain neuroscience, from internet searching to robotics and etc.
For now my current research problems it's human video-based activity recognition and neuromarketing. First topic it is my feature bachelor thesis. And second is good idea for start-up, recently some  interested in this idea  people  found me.
