## Paper 1 Draft

**Task** : *Your first assignment is to write about yourself-about your own intellectual interests and passions. In particular, I would like you to address the question: What scientific or technological issues, questions or problems most deeply interest you, and how do you think those interests will shape your life?*

If you would ask me about my technological and research interests my answer will be simple and difficult simultaneously. It is machine learning, signal processing and computer vision. It is easy because I really know answer. It’s probably difficult because this term required some explanations for other people. 

For example If someone knows that I am a programmer usually he or she ask me what I am doing. It is typical dialog for me and non-IT persons:

> -- Do you program web  or android apps?

> -- No. I am interested in computer vision.

> -- WAT? What is this?

>	-- Sigh……..

So, let me describe it for you. I try to do it without using specific terminology.

Machine learning is a sub-branch of mathematics and AI that gives computers the ability to solve some problems using only input data. Mostly it’s based on statistics and optimization. Unfortunately, Machine learning сant solve only  some specifictask only after very  long computations that called. It is ok to build program that will separate cat photos from dog photos. But this program will be not able to   drive a car. For now we far from real AI like in movies.
As it named signal processing has deal with signals. Signals from satellites, from your audio player, even digital images is a multi-dimensional signals. In other words, these signals a just the real world sensory data which we transmit from or to computers.

And at the last computer vision branch of computing that try to learn computers understand real word by input images. It is opposite to computer graphic which try to build representation of real word inside computers. 
These areas highly overlapped and contribute to each other. Why I like these fields? Because it has range of applications in different domains: from financial markets to brain neuroscience, from internet searching to robotics and etc. And for strong researches it easy to switch from one to other because it has similar approaches for significantly different problems. One model can be helpful stock exchange or in clinical trials. 

And it’s funny it is possible to look to it like to funny games. There are a lot of online machine learning and computer vision competitions where people with different background can solve real tasks that will be important to business or to society or even  to all real word!

Do you want help to scientist find Higgs boson? Or to help children with epilepsy? Ok. It is all real examples of such online competitions.  More over it is not necessary to be IT person for it. I now when political scientist won one competition. Actually He was good statistician, but anyway I thinks that this doors one for all.

For now my current research problems is human video-based activity recognition and neuromarketing. 

First topic it is my feature bachelor thesis. I have pleasure work in one laboratory at Innopolis University.  I will try build system that can recognize action of sportsmens.

And second is a good idea for start-up, recently some interested in this idea people found me. Neuromarketing it overlap for neuroscience and marketing. We can measure brain activity or even muscular activity and try to understand what customer think about think that he want to buy. 

How this those interests will shape my life? I really want to get doctoral degree and make career in R&D and academia. I am really interested in research. It is doesn't matter will it be candidate of science in Russia or PhD in abroad. I think I am forever student. Before Innopolis I got graduate degree in automatic control engineering at local university. Sometimes I ask myself is it 7 years of university life enough? May be yes, but doctoral degree is my goal in next few years anyway.
